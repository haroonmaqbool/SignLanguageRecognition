# Skeleton Code for Sign Language Recognition Project

This folder has skeleton/template code with TODO comments to help you implement the project.

## Files

1. train_model_skeleton.py - Build and train CNN/LSTM models
2. evaluate_model_skeleton.py - Test model performance
3. app_skeleton.py - Flask web app for predictions
4. realtime_detection_skeleton.py - Real-time webcam detection

## How to Use

1. Copy skeleton files to main folder (or use them as-is)
2. Complete all TODO sections
3. Run and test your code

## Order

1. Start with train_model_skeleton.py
2. Then evaluate_model_skeleton.py
3. Then app_skeleton.py or realtime_detection_skeleton.py

## Notes

- Each file has TODO comments showing what to implement
- Basic structure is provided, just fill in the code
- You can modify and improve as needed

## Requirements

- Need preprocessed data from preprocessing.py first
- Need trained models for evaluation/app/realtime
- Install all libraries from requirements.txt
